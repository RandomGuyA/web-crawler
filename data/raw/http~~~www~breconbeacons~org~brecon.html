<p>
<span style="font-family: &apos;trebuchet ms&apos;, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">A thriving market town in the Usk Valley, Brecon was established as a town in Norman times  </span></p>
<span style="color:#696969;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Narrow compact streets, Georgian facades and the restored canal basin tell tales of times gone by. For culture, seek out the 12th century cathedral, South Wales Borderers Military Museum, and Brecknock Museum and Art Gallery. Brecon offers many places to eat and stay and the Brecknock Farmers Market, on the second Saturday of every month, is the biggest in the area.
<br />
<br />Specialist independent retailers offer unique and affordable products with a warm and friendly service. Local organic and specialist foods are in abundance and always worth seeking out. More active visitors will enjoy the outdoor shops, bike hire and the Taff Trail cycle path from Brecon. With a professional theatre and independent cinema, pubs and restaurants and a leisure centre for rainy days, there&apos;s always something to do in this wonderful market town.
<br />
<br />Both the Taff Trail and the Usk Valley Walk start at Brecon, the one headed south over the mountains for Cardiff, the other down the Usk Valley to Caerleon.
<br />
<br />More information about the town and surrounding area can be obtained from Brecon Tourist Information Centre.</span></span></span><br />

It's only a ten-minute walk from the Georgian market town of Brecon, yet the only buildings visible are our farmhouse and watermill.\r\n&nbsp;We have enjoyed looking after campers here at our home for over fourteen years, where we've tried to get the right balance between what to provide for a special stay, and what to omit if we feel it would disfigure the natural, unspoilt character of the place. Our set-up will not appeal to all campers: we don't yet have hot water for washing dishes, there are only two hot showers (50p for 5 mins), there are no set pitches or clubhouse, the grass in the meadow is cut short but not manicured, we don't have electric hook-ups, and we expect everyone to embrace separating waste items into our recycling bins &ndash; a chore not everyone wants to undertake when in holiday mood. On top of all this we ask for quiet after 10.30pm and the parking of cars on allocated standing to avoid turning the grass muddy. Phew... that's a lot to take in!\r\n&nbsp;As campers ourselves we feel the essential ingredients for optimum enjoyment of the outdoors have to include a campfire, by a river, in untouched countryside, where everyone has room to spread out. This is what we have at Priory Mill. We lend fire-trays for our supplied charcoal and firewood, there is a freezer for your ice-packs, for cyclists and backpackers there's a stack of log seats, if you've finished with your paperback you can exchange it at our book swap, and we'll charge your iPod or phone etc. in the kitchen.\r\n&nbsp;We're passionate about sustaining this simple, low-impact way of camping and welcome all who feel the same.","url":"\/businesses\/3068"}},{"id":"priory_mill_","lat":51.95716831902,"lon":-3.3852677910156,"enhanced":true,"type":"accommodation","popup":{"title":"Priory Mill Farm, Self Catering Cottage","image":"\/website\/var\/tmp\/thumb_1927__business_listing_thumb.jpeg","text":"Priory Mill Cottage, which was originally the farm granary, is accessed up a flight of stone steps beyond the farmhouse. Quiet and secluded, overlooking a part of the river and ancient woodland. The cottage also has its own garden. There is one bedroom, with a handmade, king size bed. Retaining the original oak beams and oak floors throughout, the historic opulence is further enhanced by rich textiles and rugs, and antique furniture. The spacious kitchen is handmade to a very high standard, containing double oven, fridge, freezer, microwave, dishwasher and washing machine. More essential necessities for total self indulgence include CD, DVD, ipod Docking Station and Digital TV, and Wi-Fi, with a selection of CDs, DVDs, local interest guides and books. One pet welcome, lockable bike storage, cot and high chair, and outside there are woodland walks and 3\/4 mile of private fishing. Priory Mill Farm, located in the Brecon Beacons National Park, is situated just&nbsp;ten minutes walk from the Georgian town of Brecon. It dates back beyond the sixteenth century and still strongly evokes a true sense of past times, with its cobbled court yard between the miller's house and the stunning Grade II* corn mill, behind which runs the River Honddu.","url":"\/businesses\/2814"}},[],{"id":"roberto_s","lat":51.9469044,"lon":-3.3924026,"enhanced":null,"type":"food","popup":{"title":"Roberto's","image":"","text":"","url":"\/businesses\/3234"}},{"id":"sable_and_hogg_gallery","lat":51.9480634,"lon":-3.3909544000001,"enhanced":null,"type":"retail","popup":{"title":"Sable and Hogg Gallery ","image":"","text":"","url":"\/businesses\/3299"}},{"id":"sirius","lat":51.9477483,"lon":-3.3902317,"enhanced":null,"type":"retail","popup":{"title":"Sirius","image":"","text":"","url":"\/businesses\/3417"}},{"id":"stay_at_no_10","lat":51.949489,"lon":-3.397522,"enhanced":true,"type":"accommodation","popup":{"title":"Stay at No 10","image":"\/website\/var\/tmp\/thumb_6063__business_listing_thumb.jpeg","text":"No 10 offers luxurious accommodation for groups of up to 15 people looking to enjoy all that the Brecon Beacons has to offer.
