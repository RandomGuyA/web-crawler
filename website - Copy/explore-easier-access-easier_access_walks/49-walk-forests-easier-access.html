<h1>49. Forestry trails with easier access</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p>Natural Resources Wales manages several forests within the National Park which have Open Access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Most of the forests have designated car parks and compacted stone tracks which encourage easier access.
<br/>
<br/>Many of the forest tracks are used for taking timber out of the forests by lorry. More and more sites now have an accessible gap by the side of the main forestry gates allowing barrier-free access along the main tracks.
<br/>
<br/>Please note that some of the forests are in remote locations with some steep tracks and much of the land where trees grow is soft, so ground conditions are not always suitable for building and maintaining routes which are fully accessible. The condition of the forestry tracks varies greatly between different forests, especially when tree harvesting is taking place, when the tracks will be closed off.
