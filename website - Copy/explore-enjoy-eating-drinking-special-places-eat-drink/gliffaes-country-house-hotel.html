<h1>Gliffaes Country House Hotel, Crickhowell</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Gliffaes has atmosphere in spades. As you find yourself passing a wicker basket of muddy wellies or a stack of fishing rods in the hall, you'll feel you're in a friendâ€™s country house.</span></p>

You can try out your fly-fishing skills here (if you catch it theyâ€™ll cook it) or stroll among the unusual trees in the 33 acres of grounds.</p>
<p>James Suter and his wife Susie run the hotel â€“ a third generation family business. Thanks to their â€˜slow foodâ€™ ethos the menu features lamb, venison, beef and pork from the local area. Theyâ€™ve even raised their own rare breed pigs. Thereâ€™s also likely to be rabbit and pheasant on the menu â€“ caught so locally you can likely see the field where it came from. Other food comes from suppliers within a 75-mile radius as far as possible.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a garden which contributes seasonal produce and fish is Marine Stewardship Council-recognised. Recent food departures have included experimenting with foraging recipes, foraging days with an expert guide.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s no wonder many visitors return year after year and, sometimes, generation after generation, as the guest books and fishing logs show.</p>
