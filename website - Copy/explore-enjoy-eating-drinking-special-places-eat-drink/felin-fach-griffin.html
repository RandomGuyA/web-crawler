<span style="font-size:18px;">With its pub atmosphere and locally-sourced quality food, the Felin Fach Griffin quickly made its mark among the gastropub crowd when it opened in 2000.</span></p>

<p>The manager of the Griffin, Julie Bell, puts the Griffin’s success down to keeping the food as locally-sourced (and therefore as fresh) as possible. </p>
<p>There’s a kitchen garden which is organically certified and a full-time gardener, Joe (pictured below), whose produce goes straight to the kitchen. Any excess goes to local suppliers to make products that are used back in the pub – blackcurrants become cassis, other soft fruit reappears as jam for breakfast.</p>
<p>Meat is sourced from nearby producers including the Welsh Venison Centre which is around 10 miles away. Many beers are local too and there’s wine from the Wye Valley’s Ancre Hill Estate, alongside others from further afield.</p>
<p>But despite its success, the Griffin hasn’t moved too far from its roots – so while it attracts foodies from far and wide, locals still pop in for a pint after walking the dog.</p>
