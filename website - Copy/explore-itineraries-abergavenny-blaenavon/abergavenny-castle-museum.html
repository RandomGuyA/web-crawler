<h1>Abergavenny Museum and Abergavenny Castle</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p><strong>Enjoy a day out visiting two attractions in one. Abergavenny</strong><img src="/all_images_in_here_please/towns/abergavenny_castle_and_muesuem.png" style="width: 162px; margin: 12px; float: right; height: 244px;"/><strong>Â Museum is set in the grounds of a 'ruined' Norman castle,Â </strong><strong>where you can enjoy a picnic during the summer and a briskÂ </strong><strong>walk on colder days.</strong><br/>
<br/>Although the original castle is now largely in ruins there is still aÂ tall stretch of curtain wall to the right of what would have beenÂ the gatehouse, originally from the 12th Century.
<br/>
<br/>The museum is housed in a former 19th Century hunting lodgeÂ built by the Marquess of Abergavenny within the walls of theÂ castle. The museum has five permanent displays which tell theÂ story of this historic market town from prehistory through to the
<br/>present day.
