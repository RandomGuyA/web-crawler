<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Abergavenny</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Set on the banks of the river Usk at the National Parkâ€™s eastern edge, the bustling market town of Abergavenny is the perfect base for riverside strolls and more strenuous walks on surrounding mountains like the Blorenge, Sugar Loaf and Skirrid. Walkers have healthy appetites, so itâ€™s good to know that itâ€™s also home to the annual Abergavenny Food Festival, one of the UKâ€™s top foodie events.</span></div>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Brecon</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Situated at the confluence of the rivers Usk and Honddu, Brecon is the beating heart of the National Park. This charming town boasts its own cathedral, Georgian architecture, a regular farmersâ€™ market and access to a huge range of walks. Be sure to visit the Brecon Beacons National Park Visitor Centre situated at nearby Libanus. Itâ€™s the best place to get more information on where to walk â€“ our experts will help you. The centre itself is the ideal starting point for walks both big and small.</span></div>

<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Crickhowell</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Thanks to its superb choice of routes and increasingly popular annual walking festival the pretty little town of Crickhowell has a big reputation as a walking destination. Youâ€™ll find gentle strolls along the river Usk and the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, plus more strenuous climbs up peaks like flat-topped Table Mountain overlooking the town. Itâ€™s also a convenient gateway to the borderland Black Mountains.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Hay-on-Wye</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">The world-famous â€˜town of booksâ€™ is well known for its starry annual literary festival, but itâ€™s an equally stellar walking destination. The Offaâ€™s Dyke Path â€“ which stretches for 177 miles (283km) along the Wales/England border â€“ and the 136-mile (218km) Wye Valley Walk bothÂ¬ pass through Hay-on-Wye. As well as the famous Hay Festival there is also a lively walking festival held every October.Â </span></div>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Llandovery</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This historic market and droving town is the ideal hub from which to discover the National Parkâ€™s lesser-known western reaches. Itâ€™s the gateway to the 300-square-mile (763-sq-km) Fforest Fawr Geopark, a stunning swathe of upland country packed with walks exploring the landscapeâ€™s geological heritage. With its 12th-century Norman castle, cobbled market square, brightly painted buildings and visitor/heritage centre, the town itself is also well worth exploring on foot.</span></div>

<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Talgarth</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Billed as the â€˜Gateway to the Black Mountainsâ€™, Talgarth is a popular destination for enthusiastic hill walkers, though thatâ€™s far from the full picture. The nearby nature reserves of Pwll-y-Wrach and Parkwood offer less strenuous strolls in some of the National Parkâ€™s prettiest landscapes. Find out whatâ€™s on offer at Talgarthâ€™s annual walking festival, which takes place each May. Â And whilst you are there, try visiting Talgarth Mill which featured on the BBCâ€™s Village SoS programme.</span></div>
