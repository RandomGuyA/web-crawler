<h1>An irresistible Offa</h1>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Offaâ€™s Dyke Path National Trail stretches 177 miles (283km) along the boundary between Wales and England, following in the main the ancient earthen border created by King Offa of Mercia in the 8th century. Â The two-year, Â£1 million â€˜Walking with Offaâ€™ project saw the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority collaborate with a number of tourism partners in both England and Wales to promote opportunities for walkers along the full length of the National Trail.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">The whole borderland between England and Wales is superb walking territory. Â In order to make it even more accessible, the project has focused on improving access, developing and promoting new circular walks and linking into bus services. New interpretive materials have been produced to encourage walking, including a Walking with Offa map that highlights walks, bus routes and key landmarks across the region.Â </span></div>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Just like Offaâ€™s original earthworks, Walking with Offa covers a lot of ground. Weâ€™ve been working Â with a partnership of organisations comprising Offaâ€™s Dyke Path National Trail, Monmouthshire County Council, Powys County Council, adventa, Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (ANOB), Â Clwydian Range AONB, Shropshire Hills AONB Partnership, Shropshire Council, the VITAL Herefordshire LEADER programme, Visit Herefordshire, Cadwyn Clwyd and Denbighshire County Council and Northern Marches.</span></div>
