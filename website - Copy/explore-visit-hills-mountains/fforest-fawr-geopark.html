<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">This unique region is a cracked and crumpled layer-cake of rocks, 480 million years in the making. Its landscapes were sculpted by ice then transformed by man, and it was a witness to the birth of the Industrial Revolution. It contains important habitats for rare plants, birds, insects and lichens.</span></p>

<a href="http://www.fforestfawrgeopark.org.uk" target="_blank">www.fforestfawrgeopark.org.uk</a>) is a geologically significant part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. It covers the western half of our Park, from Llandovery in the north to Merthyr Tydfil in the south and from Llandeilo in the west to Brecon in the east.</p>
<p>Accepted into the European Geopark Network in 2005 as Walesâ€™ first geopark, it takes its name from the Fforest Fawr uplands which lie within the Geopark.Â </p>
<p>The purpose of the Geopark is to generate social, environmental and economic benefits. Working with and for our local communities, it will achieve this by focusing on conserving our geological, cultural and biological heritage, fostering research into earth sciences and climate change and promoting sustainable economic development, especially sustainable tourism.</p>
