<strong>Terrain</strong>At first the route follows the smooth gravel surface of the towpath of the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal.

More up to date information on the surface can be found on the Canals and Rivers Trust website. The towpath is shared with walkers and a "Share the space – drop your pace"approach should be used.
