<h2>What to doÂ </h2>
<h3>1. Tasters (for beginners)</h3>
<p>If you're new to mountain biking, then hiring a qualified instructor lets you try things out in safest, the most hassle-free way possible. You can dodge the strain of map reading by allowing an expert with local knowledge to show you the way. An activity provider can also impart some top tips on how to ride a mountain bike correctly over different terrain, working the gears to match the hills and using the brakes to control your descents.</p>
<h3>2. Improvers (for returners and skills builders)</h3>
<p>Perhaps you're still leaarning, or you're an experienced rider visiting the park for the first time. Why not take your riding to the next level and hire a mountain bike guide to lead you on some of the UKâ€™s most exciting mountain bike routes. Guides can offer specialist coaching, fitness training, maintenance and knowledge of local routes.Â </p>
<h3>3. Independent experiences (for enthusiasts and experts)</h3>
<p>If you just want a bike for the day to explore, you can hire one from the mountain bike hire providers in the park. They can also help you choose a suitable starting point for your journey. If you've brought your own bike and equipment, take your pick from our graded mountain bike routes. Just remember â€“ the hills are big in the park and the mountains can be a wild place to be during adverse weather. If you are unsure or need further information then visit a local bike shop for some up to date information.</p>
