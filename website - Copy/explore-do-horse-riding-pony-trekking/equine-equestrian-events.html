<span style="font-size:18px;">Fancy a flutter? During the summer there are several opportunities to attend sporting events in our Park.</span></p>
<h2>International events</h2>
<p>Glanusk Estate (
<a href="http://www.glanuskestate.com" target="_blank">www.glanuskestate.com</a>) near Crickhowell hosts International Horse Trials in late June and International Polo in early July.</p>
<h2>Harness racing</h2>
<p>During the summer you can see harness races at the hard track at the Amman Valley Trotting Club (
<a href="http://www.ammanvalleytrotting.co.uk" target="_blank">www.ammanvalleytrotting.co.uk</a>), Ammanford. Trotting races are normally associated with America, but Wales has a dedicated following of this modern-day version of charioteering, known as â€˜harness racingâ€™. Highly trained horses career around the track without breaking into a canter.</p>
<p>The public are welcome to attend meets. Most provide on-course betting to add extra spice to the experience.</p>
