<h2>
<strong>Carmarthen town</strong></h2>
<p>Discover Carmarthen, originally the site of a Roman military fort and the walled town known as Moridunum, or the Fort by the sea. It is thought to have become the capital of the Demetae tribe, the native population living Romanised lifestyles. The boundaries of the walled town can still be picked out in modern street patterns but most of the secrets of the Roman settlement remain buried beneath the modern town.
