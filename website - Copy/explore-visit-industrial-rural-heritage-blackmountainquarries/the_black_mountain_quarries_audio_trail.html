<h1>The Black Mountain Quarries Audio Trail</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p>Today, visitors to the Black Mountain Quarries can enjoy breath-taking panoramic views from the quarries and can discover the fascinating story of this once thriving lime industry. Starting from either of the two car parks at the site, a way-marked walk will take you along grassy paths and stony tracks through a landscape of quarries and the remains of numerous lime kilns spanning at least 200 years. The quarries are home to several plant species that thrive in the limestone environment and the highly alkaline conditions created by the remains of the lime industry.
<br/>Â 
<br/>The route is generally easy-going, but with some short steeper parts. At the top of the site you will find interpretation boards describing the history and geology of the quarries. A dial-up or downloadable audio trail will conjure up the past as characters tell of their lives working in the quarries.
