<strong>Advice on visiting</strong><br/>The trail follows existing grassy or stony paths and is fairly flat with some short steeper slopes. The surrounding terrain is rough tussocky grassland and rocky terrain. Areas of short grass and exposed rock can be slippery when wet. Stick to the paths; spoil heaps, scree slopes and quarry faces should not be climbed.Â 
<br/>Â 
<br/>The weather on the Black Mountain can be harsh and unpredictable. Be prepared; check the weather forecast and take suitable clothing and waterproofs with you. There is decent mobile phone signal throughout the site however there may not be full data connection.
<br/>Â 
<br/>The quarries are owned by the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority and are located on open access land. Please be aware that the land is a wildlife habitat and is used for grazing livestock. In order to protect nesting birds, lambs and sheep, dogs must be on a fixed lead whenever livestock are near, and at all times from 1 March to 31 July.
