<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">and steep sided valley the reserve is an oak-ash woodland. at the eastern end of the reserve the
<br/>river enig plunges to create a spectacular waterfall into a dark pool below known as the â€˜WitchesÂ Poolâ€™ from which the reserve gets its name. although beautiful all year the reserve is perhaps at its
<br/>finest in spring when the bluebells carpet the woodland floor. a surfaced easy access path leadsÂ from the main car park into the reserve â€“ but a more uneven sometimes muddy path leads up to
<br/>the waterfall. Return to talgarth and park in the main car park. Walk towards the town centre and stop at the 13thÂ century Tower House. although its original use is unclear it is thought that it was intended to defendÂ the crossing of the river enig and the town. In later times the tower was used as a base to collectÂ rents and tithes by the ashburnham estate. It is now home to the Talgarth Information and ResourceÂ Centre â€“ staffed by volunteers who will be able to answer your questions on the local area.
<br/>From July 2011 you will be able to visit the newly restored Talgarth Mill. the town are recent winnersÂ of the BBC Village sos Big lottery competition and won funding to restore the watermill to working
<br/>order. the restored Water Mill also includes a riverside cafe, offering freshly baked products which sells local produce and gifts.
<br/>After lunch enjoy a walk on the newly restored accessible riverside paths. For those wanting toÂ stretch their legs a little more why not take the brisk ten minute stroll to Bronllys Castle.Â Now in the care of Cadw the mid 12th century stone keep with fantastic views perches atop anÂ earlier motte overlooking the river llynfi and talgarth. historic documents tell us that history wasÂ changed here when a large piece of masonry fell from the castle and killed the last male heir ofÂ Miles of gloucester.</span></span></p>
