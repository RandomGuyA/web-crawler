Crannogs are a type of ancient lake dwelling built out on the water as a defensive homestead â€“ the one at llangorse is the only one in Wales and is thought to have been the residence for the royal family of Brycheiniog in the 10th Century. you can view it from the reconstructed historic roundhouse that also acts as an i</span></span><img alt="Feeding ducks at Llangors Lake" src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/itineraries/talgarth_itineraries_-_llangors_lake.png" style="width: 200px; height: 400px; margin: 8px; float: right;"/>nterpretation centre â€“ you can even get married there if the fancy takes you!</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">take the way marked lake trail around the Western edge of the lake to Llangasty Church. Whilst the flower meadows towards llangasty church are at their best in the summer months â€“ the winter has its own pleasures, as the lake plays host to over twenty species of over-wintering birds which can beÂ enjoyed from the Llangasty bird hide â€“ which you will pass on the trail. Your turning point is at the Church of St Gastyn at llangasty â€“ although the building now present was extensively restored in the nineteen century â€“ st gastyn was a holy man who kept the flame of Christianity alight in the Western world in the fifth century and the first church was built on this site over fifteen hundred years ago. return by the same route to the car park and take a well deserved lunch either at the cafe at the lake or at one of the pubs in llangors village.
<br/>After lunch return to talgarth stopping off in Trefeca to visit the museum at Coleg trefeca, the home of howell harris, the leader of the Welsh Methodist revival in the early 18th Century.</span></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bring the afternoon to a close with a visit to the Church of St Gwendoline in talgarth. This historic Church dates back in places to the thirteenth century and is famous as the Church where howell harris was converted and eventually buried â€“ If you are lucky you might hear the bell practice â€“ as the six bellsÂ are capable of up to 38 peels.</span></span></p>
