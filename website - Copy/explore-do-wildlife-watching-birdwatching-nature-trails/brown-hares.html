<h1>Brown hares in the Brecon Beacons National Park</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Hares favour open grasslands and arable fields, which give them an unobstructed view of the surrounding area so they can watch for potential predators.</span></p>
<p>The brown hare was once widespread on the open habitats of Wales. Hare numbers have been greatly affected by changes in agriculture leading to a loss of suitable or undisturbed habitat. Only the water vole has suffered a greater rate of decline over the last few decades.</p>
