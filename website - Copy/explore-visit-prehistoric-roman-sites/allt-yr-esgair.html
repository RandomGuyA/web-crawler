<span style="font-size:18px;">Allt-yr-Esgair is a hill with panoramic views of the Usk Valley to the west and south and across Llangorse Lake to the Black Mountains to the northeast.</span></p>
<p>In Welsh, Allt-yr-Esgair means wooded slope of the ridge. Locally, the hill is known as The Allt.</p>
<p>The summit (393m) is crowned by a hillfort presumed to be of Iron Age origin, one of several in the Usk Valley. The Roman road that links the Roman fort of CICVCIVM at Y Gaer, Brecon and Gobannium at Abergavenny runs along the ridge.</p>
