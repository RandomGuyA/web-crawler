<h1>Cyfarthfa Castle, Museum and Gallery</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Surrounded by beautiful parkland, this 19th century extravagance serves as a reminder of the Ironmasters' former dominance over Merthyr Tydfil and the wealth the iron industry brought to the area. Its museum houses a fantastic collection of artefacts spanning 2000 years of local history.</span></p>
<p>The wealthy Ironmaster William Crawshay commissioned Cyfarthfa Castle, a grand mansion in the style of a castellated fortress, in 1824. It overlooked his immensely successful ironworks and has been called the most impressive monument of the Industrial Iron Age in South Wales.</p>
<p>Part of the ground floor is now a museum and gallery which houses extensive fine art, decorative art and social and industrial history collections.</p>
<p>The gallery includes Swansea, Nantgarw and Wedgwood porcelain and art by Penry Williams and George Frederick Harris, the grandfather of Rolf Harris.</p>
<p>The atmospheric museum charts the rise of this once great iron-making town. Here, you can learn about Richard Trevithick's Penydarren Locomotive of 1804, the first locomotive to pull a load along rails. Discover the roots of the Labour movement, from the Merthyr Rising of 1831, and the martyrdom of Dic Penderyn, to the first Labour MP, Keir Hardie. The first steam whistle, the first voting ballot box and dresses by Laura Ashley and Julien McDonald are all on display. Finally, see curiosities from around the world including Ancient Egyptian treasures.</p>
