<h1>Dinefwr Castle</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">This ruined medieval Welsh castle stands upon a high wooded ridge above the meandering River Towy, just west of our National Park.Â </span></p>
<p>Dinefwr Castle is thought to have been founded in the later 12th century by Lord Rhys ap Gruffudd and remodelled by Edward I in the 13th century. The visible remains date from the 13th and earlier 14th centuries.</p>
<p>It was a regional capital until the earlier 15th century, but was later replaced by Newton House, a little north. By the 17th century it had become a picturesque, romantic attraction within Dinefwr Park. The top of the great tower was taken down and replaced by a summerhouse.</p>
<p>The castle consists of two enclosures defined by deep rock-hewn ditches cutting across the summit of the ridge. The inner enclosure has a high curtain wall and is approached by a lower walled barbican. The great round tower, some 12m across, is now a two storey stump crowned by the remains of the 17th century summerhouse. There are ruins of fine towered lodgings along the northeast curtain and a smaller round tower at the northern angle.</p>
<p>The castle is now a Grade I listed, scheduled monument.</p>
