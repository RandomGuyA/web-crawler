<h1>Dinas Castle</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Not to be confused with the more well-known Castle Dinas Bran in Denbighshire, Dinas Castle in the historic county of Brecknockshire is the meagre remains of a very early Norman building of masonry and timber.</span></p>
<p>It seems likely that the castle was overrun by the Welsh in 1233, and again in 1262. It has been completely ruined for several centuries. What little remains of the Norman masonry is overgrown with greenery.</p>
