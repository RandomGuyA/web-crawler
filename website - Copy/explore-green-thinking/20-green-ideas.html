<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">There are loads of ways to make your stay in our National Park more eco-friendly. Here are some ideas to get you started.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Â </h2>
<h2>1. Stay longer</h2>
<p>A good way to reduce the damaging effects of your journeys is to make fewer of them, and stay longer instead. In the Brecon Beacons National Park, our landscapes are truly varied, with masses of activities and sights on offer. Weâ€™re sure youâ€™ll find plenty to inspire you and we would be delighted for you to spin out your stay!</p>
<h2>2. Stay somewhere eco-friendly</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">A growing number of hotels, B&amp;Bs, self-catering properties and campsites within our Park make eco-consciousness a priority by investing in renewable energy systems, using biodegradable products and supporting local businesses and craftsmen, among other forward-thinking measures.

<h2>4. Be responsible when you're out and about</h2>
