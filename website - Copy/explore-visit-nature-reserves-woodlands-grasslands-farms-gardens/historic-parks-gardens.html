However, the creation of parks and gardens has a much longer history, going as far back as Roman times.</p>
<p>Historic parks and gardens of all ages, shapes and sizes are an important part of our heritage. Whether a large parkland surrounding a mansion, the remains of a medieval deer park or a simple cottage garden, parks and gardens help our understanding of life in the past. They were as much a part of peoplesâ€™ lives as their homes and houses, and so can shed light on the priorities and interests of the people who created, owned, used and worked them. The development and evolution of a garden over time reflects changing tastes and fashions.</p>
<p>These gardens are also important for wildlife. Living things are incredibly adaptable and many species have been able to adjust to life among us and our buildings.</p>

<p>Within the Brecon Beacons National Park there are 17 parks and gardens that are registered and are of national importance, ranging in date from the 12th century to the 20th century. Most are privately owned and not publicly accessible. However, one of our Registered Parks and Gardens, Craig-y-Nos Country Park, the 40-acre grounds of the Victorian Craig-y-Nos Castle, is easily accessible and open to the public.</p>
