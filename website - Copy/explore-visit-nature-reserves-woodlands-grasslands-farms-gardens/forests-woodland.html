<h1>Forests and woodland in the Brecon Beacons National Park</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Our woodlands are wonderful to explore in any season. They stimulate the senses, from the beautiful songs of the birds and the smell of wildflowers to the crunch of leaves underfoot.</span></p>
<p>
<img src="/website/var/tmp/thumb_289__auto_450078387bf1c6122aa1db3e318c6c98.jpeg" style="width: 704px; height: 528px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right;"/>Forests and woodlands used to dominate the lowlands of our National Park. Over the centuries, as people settled here, they burnt and cut the trees until forest was replaced by field.</p>
<p>The woods that remain are small but important patches within the mosaic of farmland. Mature conifers are a more recent addition to both the upland and lowland landscape.</p>
<p>Our woods are crucial pockets of biodiversity, providing a habitat for an enormous variety of trees, mosses, fungi, insects, birds and mammals. They create a naturally shady and humid place to thrive, with plenty of cover and food. Many of our native species are dependant on woodlands for at least part of the year. Some of the species found in our woods are unique to our region.</p>
<p>A variety of different woodlands occur in differet parts of our Park, according to the soil type, drainage and altitude. Within each woodland there can be differences in tree age and the structure of the canopy. Open rides and glades, abundant deadwood from fallen trees and a thick carpet of spring flowers are all key components of any woodland.</p>

<p>Lying in a small deep valley, the little wood at Coed y Cerrig is hidden away in the southern part of Black Mountains; its moist valley floor covered by an unusual type of alder woodland. Some areas of the woodland are coppiced to maintain this unique habitat.Â The road through the reserve along the bottom of the valley was once a busy railway line burrowing deeper into the mountains, carrying materials to construct the Grwyne Fawr reservoir 14 kilometres away.

<p>The woodland of Cwm Clydach near Brynmawr (not to be confused with RSPB Cwm Clydach near Swansea) grows on steep slopes alongside a deep river gorge. It is the largest and most representative area of native beechwood in southeast Wales. The river has cut deep into the valley forming steep limestone cliffs and spectacular waterfalls. The air is humid close to the fast-moving river, and many species of moss can be found growing here. Clinging precariously to the cliffs are yew and whitebeam trees. Ground plants are relatively sparse, especially in the shade under the beech trees. A good variety of woodland birds can be seen.

<h3>Llangattock Beechwood</h3>OS grid reference: SO13176

<h3>Mynydd Du</h3>OS grid reference: SO268252
<br/>Nearest towns: Abergavenny, Hay-on-Wye

<br/>Managed by: Forestry Commission Wales
<p>The forest of Mynydd Du lies in the upper reaches of the Grwyne Fawr on the southern side of the Black Mountains. Until the 19th century the valley was intensively settled with over 30 farmsteads surrounded by small stone-walled fields. In the early 20th century the Grwyne Fawr reservoir was built at the head of the valley and a village was established to house the workers. Foundations of several village buildings, including the old stone school can still be seen.Â There are picnic sites beside the stream, ideal for peace and shade on a hot day. The most popular spot is Yr Eithin, at the upper end of the forest. From here there's a pleasant 1.5-mile walk up to the Grwyne Fawr Reservoir.</p>
<h3>Park Wood</h3>OS grid reference: SO166346
<br/>Nearest town: Talgarth
<br/>How to get there: The wood is north-east of Talgarth.
<br/>Managed by: Woodland Trust
<p>A beautiful site consisting of mature broadleaf woodland, pioneer woodland after clearfell and existing stands of conifer. Very peaceful with some woodland plants and lots of bird activity. Good views from the top of the woods.</p>
<h3>Pwll-y-Wrach Nature Reserve</h3>OS grid reference: S0165326
<br/>Nearest town: Talgarth
<br/>How to get there: The wood is one mile south-east of Talgarth. Post code: LD3 0DS.
<br/>Managed by: Brecknock Wildlife Trust
<p>Pwll-y-Wrach is 17.5 hectares of beautiful ancient woodland, sloping down to the banks of the River Enig. Near the eastern end of the reserve the river plunges over a spectacular waterfall into a dark pool known as the Witches Pool, from which the reserve gets it name.
<br/>The woodland is particularly beautiful in early spring when white patches of wood anemones merge with a yellow carpet of lesser celandines. In late spring bluebells fleck the woodland floor with shimmering blue and the white flowers of wild garlic give the air a pungent smell. Look out for the strange looking toothwort plant near the base of trees (especially hazel), down by the river. It lacks chlorophyll and is parasitic on the trees.
<br/>Dormice live in the reserve, although you are unlikely to see these golden brown creatures. In some parts of the reserve small groups of trees have been felled to encourage the food-plants of dormice, such as bramble and honeysuckle, to grow.

<br/>Managed by: Forestry Commission Wales
<p>Large upland forest situated on the south side of the Brecon Beacons, deep into the National Park. Planted around the reservoirs, Taf Fechan is a picturesque area which although popular, is a good place to find secluded picnic spots and resting places.</p>
<h3>Talybont Forest</h3>OS grid reference: SO056178
<br/>Nearest village: Talybont-on-Usk
<br/>How to get there: Turn off the A40 following signs for Talybont-on-Usk between Brecon and Bwlch. Once in Talybont-on-Usk follow signs for Talybont Reservoir, passing through the village of Aber, continuing until Forestry Commission signs are seen.
<br/>Managed by: Forestry Commission Wales
<p>Talybont forest lies along the side of Glyn Collwn and the Talybont Reservoir. At the head of the forest are the waterfalls of Blaen-y-Glyn. At the end of the 19th century the valley contained at least ten farms. Small fields with stone walls surrounded each farmstead, and the nearby woodland provided timber for building and wood for fuel. During the 19th century limestone was quarried and transported along the Brinore Tramway and Brecon-Merthyr railway to the mountains of South Wales. The old course of the railway is now part of the Taff trail which is suitable for walkers and cyclists.</p>
<h3>Waterfall Country</h3>OS grid reference: SN912079
<br/>Nearest village: Pontneddfechan
<br/>How to get there: Follow signs to Pontneddfechan/Waterfalls from the A465 (Heads of the Valley Road) from Bridgend to Penderyn.
<br/>Managed by: Forestry Commission Wales
<p>You won't find anywhere else in Wales with so many spectacular waterfalls in such a small area. Water is inseparable from the Welsh landscape whether flowing in a river or babbling in a brook. Here the rivers Mellte, Hepste and Neddfechan have worn away soft rocks to create steep wooded gorges full of caves and the famous waterfalls.</p>
