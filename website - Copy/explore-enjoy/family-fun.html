<h1>Ten ideas for family fun in the Brecon Beacons National Park</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Our National Park is the best ever playground. There are masses of things for active families to do. Of course, thereâ€™s no need to pack every day with expensive activities â€“ simple things like picnics and Pooh sticks can be just as much fun. In fact, many of our favourite ideas are absolutely free.</span></p>

<h2>3. Play I Spy in Brecon, Abergavenny or Talgarth</h2>
<p>Turn a shopping trip into a fun morning out by playing games which keep the kidsâ€™ eyes wide open. If one of our local farmersâ€™ markets is in full swing, there will be lots of goodies to taste. To find out more, visit our page onÂ

<h2>4. Go pony trekking</h2>
<p>Whether your kids are seasoned riders or absolute beginners, the qualified instructors at our riding centres will keep them safe. Kids as little as four years old can have a go. To find out more, visit our page onÂ

<h2>5. Climb a hill, go on a bug hunt and fly a kite</h2>
<p>Climb a huge hill, looking out for butterflies, bees and other insects on the way. Sugar Loaf is a good one, with Mynydd Llanwenarth car park the best starting point. The ascent is easy at first, but little legs might want to skip the steep bit near the summit. Take a kite â€“ on windy days, Sugar Loaf is a great flying spot. To find out more, visit our pages onÂ

<h2>6. Pick blackberries in the countryside</h2>
<p>In late August and September, the hedgerows are stuffed with tasty berries. As long as you keep a careful eye on them, the kids can forage to their heartsâ€™ content. To find out more, visit our page onÂ

<h2>7. Know your stalactites from your stalagmites</h2>
<p>At the
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/businesses/2725">National Showcaves for Wales,</a>safely built paths allow you to explore fabulous natural limestone caverns, complete with human skeletons. As if that wasnâ€™t exciting enough, thereâ€™s also one of the worldâ€™s largest dinosaur parks, a shire horse centre, a playbarn and more. To find out more, visit our page onÂ

<h2>8. Get muddy, climb to the tree tops and zip through the air</h2>
<p>The
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/businesses/2770">Llangorse Multi Activity Centre</a>has tons of fun challenges for kids, teenagers and adults alike, such as climbing walls, rope bridges, zip lines and a wet and muddy Dingle Scramble. Phew! To find out more, visit ourÂ

<h2>9. Stare at the stars</h2>
<p>If thereâ€™s a clear, moonless night during your visit, youâ€™re in luck. The stars will put on a show. Get hold of a book, a chart or a stargazing map, and see if you can spot some of the constellations. To find out more, visit our page onÂ

<h2>10. Look for tracks in the snow</h2>
<p>So itâ€™s been snowing. Brilliant! Itâ€™s time for snowballs, snowmen, and some wildlife detective work. Head into the countryside, or just into the garden, and see if your kids can work out which creatures have passed by during the night. To find out more, visit our pages onÂ
