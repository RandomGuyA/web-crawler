<span style="font-size:18px;">There's plenty to keep you amused in our towns and villages. Leading theatre and dance companies regularly take to the stage at our halls and venues, and there are films, concerts and comedy gigs all year round.</span></p>

<h5>Cross Street, Abergavenny NP7 5HD, Wales, tel 01873 850805,</h5>
<p>Thereâ€™s something on almost every night of the week at the Borough Theatre. A full and varied programme of touring and amateur theatre, dance, comedy and tribute bands runs throughout the year.</p>
<p>This fine Victorian theatre is part of the town hall. The building dates back to 1870 and still retains much of its period character.</p>
<p>The Boroughâ€™s studio space, the Melville Theatre, is the place to catch a small-scale production or an arthouse film.</p>
<h2>Theatr Brycheiniog, Brecon</h2>
<h5>Canal Wharf, Brecon LD3 7EW, Wales, tel 01874 611622,
<a href="http://www.brycheiniog.co.uk" target="_blank">www.brycheiniog.co.uk</a></h5>
<p>Standing beside the the colourful barges on the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal route, Theatr Brycheiniog is one of the top performing arts centres in Wales. It hosts theatre, classical music, dance, ballet, world music, folk music and jazz events, attracting more than 150,000 visitors each year.</p>
<p>Theatr Brycheiniog is also an energy-saving champion. It was the first solar-powered theatre in the country, generating a proportion of its energy requirements through photovoltaic cells on its roof. It was also one of the first theatres to install LED lighting on stage.</p>
<p>Also in the same building is the Andrew Lamont Gallery, with pieces on display from local artists, and Tipple 'n' Tiffin, a cafÃ© and bistro that has been recommended by the Good Food Guide.</p>
<h2>The Welfare, Ystradgynlais</h2>
<h5>Brecon Rd, Ystradgynlais, Swansea SA9 1JJ, Wales, tel 01639 843163</h5>
<p>This arts and community centre is a versatile venue for live music and theatre performances, with regular cinema and specialist film screenings. Children's shows and music workshops are held from time to time, and a family pantomime brings the house down in January.</p>
<h2>Festivals and special events</h2>
