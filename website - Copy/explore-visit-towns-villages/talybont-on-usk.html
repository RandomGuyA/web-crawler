<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">A pretty village nestling below the Central Beacons between the River Usk and the Monmouthshire and
<br/>Brecon Canal.</span></span><br/>Â </p>

<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">Talybont is a great place for hill walking and cycling and for gentle strolls along the canal and through the lowland countryside. It also hasÂ a good range of accommodation, excellent pubs serving food to suit all pockets. Talybont General Store is a village shop, cafeÂ and Post Office all rolled into one, and very handily it also stocks information about things to do in the local area.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">Talybont's history is closely linked to the canal which passes through the heart of the village, and to the Brinore Tramroad which links to it; an early and important transport route for coal and limestone from the coalfield valleys of south Wales. The Tramroad is a great way to explore some of the history of the local area on foot or by bike, along the valley and up in to the surrounding hills. The Taff Trail long distanceÂ walking route,Â from Cardiff Bay to Brecon, also passes through the village and offers a 55 mile long spectacular and variedÂ walking experienceÂ if you're up to the challenge.Â </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you want aÂ shorter stroll though, the Henry Vaughan walk takes you around the nearby countryside introducing you to the 18th Century poet who lived nearby. You can experience improved access with new benches, stiles and way-marking and the much talked about installation of interactive swing posts that reveal excerpts from the Vaughan brothers' notable poetry.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">Two miles south of the village you'll find Talybont Reservoir which provides opportunities for bird-watching, trout fishing and easy walking and a further 4 miles beyond is theÂ mini 'waterfalls area' at Blaen y Glyn, which is a great place for a short 1 mile walk, with aÂ spectacular waterfall halfway round. Add warm, sunny weather and it makes an ideal spot for picnics too and if you're quiet and patient you should catch sight of a small black and white bird, the Dipper, flying low above the river or perched on a rock.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;,helvetica,sans-serif;">The wide tracks in the Talybont Forest on the eastern side of the reservoir join up with the Brinore Tramroad and Taff Trail to give longer walks with no barriers.</span></span></p></div>
