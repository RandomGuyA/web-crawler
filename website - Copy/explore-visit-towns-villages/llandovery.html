<h1>Llandovery</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>Situated on the western border of the National Park, Llandovery was described by the early travel writer George Borrow asÂ 
<em>'the pleasantest little town in which I have haltedâ€™</em>.
<br/>
<br/>The town is a great base for enjoying the western Brecon Beacons. The area is popular for many outdoor activities including walking in the Black Mountain, road cycling, mountain biking at Crychan Forest and Cwm Rhaeadr, and fishing on the River Towy and
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/4-walk-usk-reservoir">Usk Reservoir</a>.
<br/>
<br/>Other local attractions include Llyn Brianne, the highest dam in Britain (229 ft, 91 m high) which was constructed in the 1960/70s to provide a regular water supply across South Wales. There are many beautiful walks in the vicinity. The nearby Dinas RSPB Nature Reserve is a peaceful woodland and river area with boardwalk.
<br/>
<br/>Llandovery is an ancient market and droving town, and has been home to aÂ host of interesting historical characters.One of the most famous residents is Llywelynap Gruffydd, a statue of whomÂ stands gleaming next door to the hill-top ruins of Llandovery Castle.Â OnceÂ theÂ locationÂ of violent attacksÂ and battles during medieval times,Â those who climb up to the castle will be rewarded with peaceful views over the town and the River Bran.
<br/>
<br/>Other interestingÂ former residents of the town includeÂ theÂ 'sweet songster' William Williams Pantycelyn who wrote the famous hymn "
<em>Guide me oh thou GreatÂ Jehovah</em>" which is sung regularly at rugby matches; and Vicar Rhys PritchardÂ who compiled the influential poemÂ 
<em>Cannwyll y Cymry</em>Â (usually translated as The Welshman's Candle), a collection of poetical teachings and moral guidance.
<br/>
<br/>Today, visitors canÂ refresh themselves in the number of cafes and tea-rooms found in the town. They may be tempted by local crafts and gifts in the shops, as well as stocking up on goodÂ quality foodÂ at the local butcher,Â deli and patisserie.
<br/>
<br/>Droving is an important part of Llandovery's history and it was this passing circus of men and animalsÂ which contributed to the architecture of the town.Don't miss the popular Llandovery Sheep Festival, held every September, where you may see live sheep racing in the street!</p>

<p>
<br/>Llandovery also has a swimming pool, and is home to Llandovery College, an independent school which has supplied a number of great players to the Welsh national rugby team.Â 
<br/>Llandovery is easily accessible on the A40Â and thereÂ are alsoÂ regular train services on the
<a href="http://www.heart-of-wales.co.uk">Heart of Wales Line</a>between Shrewsbury and Swansea, a journey which is highly recommended.
<br/>
