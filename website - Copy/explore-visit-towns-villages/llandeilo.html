<p>Nestled within the Towy Valley and surrounded by castles and gardens, Llandeilo is a gem. An ancient capital of Wales, the town has the largest single arch stone bridge in Wales (145 ft, 44 metres) which is fringed by pretty pastel-painted houses that sweep up to the town centre and church.
<br/>Llandeilo has an excellent range of independently-owned shops, from antiques, galleries and boutiques, to butchers, bakers and ice-cream makers. There are several cafÃ©s and delis selling locally-produced products. It also has its own award-winning brewery, Evan- Evans.
<br/>The Llandeilo Gospel Book, a beautifully illuminated biblical manuscript from the 8th Century, can be seen in St Teilo's Church.
