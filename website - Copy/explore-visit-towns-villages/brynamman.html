<h1>Brynamman</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p class="documentFirstHeading">The village sits at the top of the Amman Valley in the shadow of the Black Mountain. Notable people from Brynaman include Roy Noble, broadcaster and Dafydd Iwan, folk singer and politician.
<br/>At the heart of this once industrial village is the Black Mountain Centre, an old school now converted as a resource for visitors and residents - an excellent place to start exploring the area.
<br/>
<br/>The A4059 road which climbs north from the village affords spectacular views of the Brecon Beacons and Mid Wales. The old limestone and silica quarries here were recently the focus of a research, conservation and interpretation project, CALCH (Welsh for â€˜limeâ€™).Â  Stop at the Black Mountain Quarry and take a walk across the mountain to see more of the fascinating wildlife, geology and industrial heritage of the area. The weather can change rapidly so be prepared for all conditions.
<br/>
<br/>The 97 mile long Beacons Way passes through this area on its way from Bethlehem to Abergavenny. You can enjoy shorter and more sheltered walks from the Black Mountain Centre.
<br/>Visit Brynaman cinema to watch the latest films, including in 3D. Brynaman Public Hall and Cinema was built in the 1920s and funded by the "check off" system where weekly contributions were deducted from miners' wagers. To this day the cinema is run by volunteers.Â
