<h1>Hunting down the best local art, crafts and gifts</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">The landscapes of the Brecon Beacons National Park are a gift to painters, and there is a rich culture of traditional and contemporary craftsmanship here, too.</span></p>
<p>Most of our galleries and independent craft shops focus on the work of painters, sculptors, wood turners, glass blowers, soap makers, jewellers and textile artists from the immediate area. Some are run by cooperatives of artists who take turns to man the exhibition space and are always happy to chat about the work on display. For something very Welsh, look out for hand-turned wooden lovespoons, woven blankets, paintings and pottery.</p>
<p>You'll also find crafts and gifts for sale at visitor information centres and tourist offices, and at the craft fairs which take place regularly throughout the year. Keep an eye on our
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/events" target="_blank">Events</a>page for news of forthcoming events.</p>
<p>Several galleries, organisations and individuals run art and craft workshops and courses â€“ see our
