<span style="font-size:18px;">Deer were not the obvious choice of animal to farm on Andrew Morganâ€™s land on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, a traditional sheep farming region. But the move has certainly paid off</span><span style="font-size:18px;">.</span></p>

<p>A stint working in New ZealandÂ on a mixed farm which included deer convinced Andrew (pictured, right) to try something similar route on his return home. He now runs the Welsh Venison Centre with his wife Elaine, with considerable success.</p>
<p>The Centreâ€™s venison is free range quality meat thatâ€™s lean and less gamey than its wild counterpart. The animals live outdoors all year round â€“ they donâ€™t mind the cold or the rain â€“ surrounded by high fences designed to stop them jumping out.</p>
<p>Youâ€™ll find Welsh Venison Centre meat on the menu in many of the areaâ€™s top restaurants and pubs such as The Hardwick near Abergavenny, and in big name establishments further afield.</p>
<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>The Welsh Venison Centre has notched up a series of awards, including gold awards at the Royal Welsh Agricultural Societyâ€™s Winter Fair for their venison burgers (three awards for three different varieties). In the True Taste awards for 2012-13 they won a silver award for their loin of venison and a gold for their rack of Welsh lamb (they also farm sheep). The farm shop won a bronze True Taste award for 2012-13 and was a finalist in the Countryside Allianceâ€™s 2011 best Welsh local food category.</p>
