<p>At first they concentrated on self-sufficiency, holding down other jobs as they learned about keeping livestock. As their experience in farming grew, they began to sell produce at farmersâ€™ markets. They now run a burgeoning business selling produce from their free-range rare breed goats, sheep, cattle and pigs at Coity Bach Farm.</p>
<p>The animals are outdoor reared except for the pigs who shelter inside during winter (the cold makes their coats too hairy, Ceri has learned). They make butter from goatsâ€™ milk and sell lamb, beef, bacon and faggots.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s the 14 varieties of sausages made from their Gloucester Old Spot pigs that have really taken off. Unusual combinations like stilton and sun-dried tomato have got them noticed and their sweet chilli sausages are their star offering.</p>
<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>At the Royal Welsh Agricultural Societyâ€™s Winter Fair in 2012, Coity Bach won five gold awards and three silvers for their sausages. The sweet chilli sausages also took a True Taste gold award in 2012. Not a bad result for the first competition theyâ€™d ever entered.</p>
