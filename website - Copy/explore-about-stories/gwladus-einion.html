<h1>Gwladus and Einion</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>

<span style="font-size:18px;">If you're planning to visit the charming, secluded falls of Sgwd Gwladus on the River Pyrddin near Pontneddfechan, you may be interested in the legend of Gwladus, the princess whose name has been given to the falls.</span></p>

<p>Sadly the relationship was never allowed to develop and Gwladus, tormented with sadness for her unrequited love, mysteriously became immortalised, her spirit flowing freely as this serene waterfall.</p>
<p>As for Einion, he too became immortalised in the form of a waterfall further upstream, a tall crooked cascade over the rocky levels which finally drops 20m into the pool below.</p>
<p>Unlike the route to Sgwd Gwladus, the route to Sgwd Einion Gam has no path. The River Pyrddin needs to be crossed several times in order to reach this waterfall.</p>
<p>Although Gwladus could never be with her lover in life, in immortality their spirits flow together for all eternity in the pool below Sgwd Gwladus.</p>
