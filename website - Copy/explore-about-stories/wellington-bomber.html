<span style="font-size:18px;">In 1940 Britain was bombarded by wave after wave of German aircraft trying to smash the country's infrastructure and spirit. Air strikes flattened many towns and cities. Britain fought back, but paid a terrible price. Among the dead were the six-strong crew of a Wellington Bomber, Flight T2520, which crashed on the southern fringe of the Brecon Beacons.</span></p>

On its return, it flew into bad weather and crashed into the mountains above Trefil in the early hours of the morning, killing all six of the crew on board.</p>
<p>Those who lost their lives in that fateful crash were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot Officer Albert Tindall (21 years)</li>
<li>Sergeant David Mills: Pilot (21 years)</li>
<li>Sergeant Hylton Daniel Ellis: Observer/Nose Gunner (26 years)</li>
<li>Sergeant Stanley Gordon Howard: Air Gunner</li>
<li>Sergeant Reginald Brown: Air Gunner (22 years)</li>
<li>Sergeant David Ernest Wallace: Air Gunner</li></ul>
<p>115 Squadron which the plane belonged to still exists today.</p>
<p>You can visit the cairn that marks the site of the crash (grid ref: SO 090137) on Cefn yr Ystrad, at an altitude of about 600m.</p>
<p>Each year Tredegar Town Council place a wreath on the cairn in memory of those who sacrificed their lives. The next memorial service will be held on Saturday 9th November 2013 - a bus will leave from the Top House at 10am.</p>
