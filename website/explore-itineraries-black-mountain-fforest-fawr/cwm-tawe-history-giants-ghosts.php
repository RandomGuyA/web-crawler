<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img alt="Henryhd waterfall" src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/itineraries/cwm_tawe_itineraries/cwm_tawe_4_henrhyd_falls__ynyscedwen_ironworks.png" style="width: 200px; height: 404px; margin: 8px; float: right;"/>AÂ perfect day out for culture seekers start with a visit to the Ynyscedwen Ironworks at Ystradgynlais, where over 1000 men worked in 1853 using a new smelting process discovered by David Thomas, who later moved to theÂ USA and became the father of the American iron industry.
<br/>
<br/>This area sometimes known as the Land of the Sleeping Giant, as the distinctive profile of the Cribarth mountain looks like a giant on his back catching forty winks. Another dramatic natural sight is theÂ Henrhyd waterfall, at 27 metres the highest in South Wales. A steep walk takes you to the foot of the falls and you can then follow a path further downstream through a wonderful â€˜Celtic rainforestâ€™ to where the small fast flowing Llech joins the Tawe, passing an old woollen watermill known locally as the â€˜The</span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Factoryâ€™. An audio trail on the route tells stories of the area and gives ample opportunity to rest and take it all in.

Inside there is a beautiful Grade 1 listed theatre built by Madame Patti and it is reputed that her ghostly voice can sometimes still be heard.
<br/>
<br/>Take a walk through the adjacent county park was formerly the pleasure gardens of the castle and end the day with tea and cake at the Changing Seasons CafÃ© in the park.</span><br/>
