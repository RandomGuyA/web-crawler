<h1>Church of St David, Llanthony</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">St David's at Llanthony PrioryÂ has links with the sixth century and the days of the Celtic saints.</span></p><p>After the departure of the Romans, the Celts held on to their Christianity when the Saxon invaders, who were pagan, pushed them back into Wales and to the north. The early saints were often hermits who lived solitary lives of prayer and contemplation. It is said that St David lived here in a cell.</p>
<p>Such a saint usually attracted followers, and a type of monastic community was often formed, consisting of stone or timber cells clustered round a church, enclosed within a 'llan'.</p>
<p>The church is a Grade I listed building. It stands to the south of the main priory buildings.</p>
