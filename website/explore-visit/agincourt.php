<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The Battle of Agincourt, on 25 October 1415, is one of the best-known events in British history. The story of Henry Vâ€™s forces epic defeat of a much larger French army has been immortalised in tales, plays and poetry familiar to all. What is less well known is the role played by Wales in Henryâ€™s stirring victory. Five hundred Welsh archers and 23 men-at-arms travelled to fight in France â€“ many of them from the Breconshire and Monmouthshire region â€“ along with a contingent of archers and miners from the Forest of Dean.</span></p>
