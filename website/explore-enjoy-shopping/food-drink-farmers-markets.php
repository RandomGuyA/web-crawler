<p>It's well worth shopping local when you're in the Brecon Beacons. We're known for our outstanding mountain lamb (look out for Brecknockshire Cheviots, the local breed), beef, venison and smoked products of all kinds. We have yummy local cheeses like Y Fenni (Welsh for Abergavenny), St Illtyd (who spent a lot of time round here) and Pwll Mawr cheddar (which is matured in a coal mine). You're also bound to love our apple juice, cider, whisky, mineral water and scrumptious ice cream.</p>
