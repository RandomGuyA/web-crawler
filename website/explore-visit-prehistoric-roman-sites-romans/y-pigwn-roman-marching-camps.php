<span style="font-size:18px;">Constructed in just a few hours, impressive marching camps like the ones at Y Pigwn were only occupied for a few nights, maybe even just one.</span></p>

The first camp, constructed approximately 70AD, was the base for 5000 troops and the second slightly later camp overlapping the first housed around 4000.</p>
<p>These marching camps were built by Roman soldiers during their campaign against the local tribes to bring the Roman Empire and the Roman way of life to Wales.</p>
<p>Speed was of the essence. Within a few hours of arrival, they had the defences built, fires lit, tents up and dinner on the go.</p>
