<p>It is thought to have been built over 50 years after Y Pigwn, in the second century AD, by which time the Roman conquest of Wales was complete, with a series of forts, fortlets and roads strategically placed to control important locations and route ways.</p>
<p>By the second century AD the track across the Mynydd Bach Trecastell had become a busy and important trading route linking Brecon to Llandovery. This route required a fortlet to guard and maintain it.</p>
