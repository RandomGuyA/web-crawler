<span style="font-size:18px;">At this country house hotel, diners can eat where they feel comfortable â€“ maybe in the library, or in the conservatory with its mouth-watering view of the Brecon Beacons.Â </span></p>

According to chef and co-owner Sean Gerrard, youâ€™d be as welcome in muddy cycling shorts as you would in a jacket and tie. They have the Walkers Are Welcome and Cyclists Welcome accreditation to prove it.Â </p>
<p>Sean and his two co-owners have been running hotels and restaurants in the area since the early 1990s and are on first-name terms with their food suppliers. One is a relative who farms at Glaisfer Uchaf, source of most of the hotelâ€™s lamb, chicken, duck and pork. Organic vegetables come from Primrose Earth Centre in Talgarth and Penpont near Brecon. Game comes from local shoots, salmon from the
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/businesses/4399">Black Mountains Smokery</a>in Crickhowell, bread from
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/businesses/3455">Talgarthâ€™s own grain mill</a>and cheese from local artisan makers.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s in season informs the menu. That even means incorporating produce offered by green-fingered neighbours.</p>
<p>So they may decide to serve purple sprouting broccoli from a gardener down the road who pops in with his glut, or salmon from a local fisherman.</p>
