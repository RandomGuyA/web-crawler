<h1>Top three places for waterfalls in the Brecon Beacons National Park</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Of all the many places to see waterfalls in our Park, here are three of the best.</span></p>

<p>Nestled into the southern slopes of the Fforest Fawr massif, west of Merthyr Tydfil,
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/waterfall-country">Waterfall Country</a>is one of the most beautiful and popular parts of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark, with steep, tree-lined gorges and an abundance of tumbling water. The main entry point to the region is the village of Pontneddfechan.</p>
<h2>2. Blaen-y-Glyn: lively waters</h2>
<p>Much of the water that fills Talybont Reservoir begins its journey high up in the mountains at the head of the Talybont Valley in the eastern Beacons. At Blaen-y-Glyn, the infant River Caerfanell, the Nant Bwrefwr and other streams tumble down from the hills over tremendous clusters of picturesque waterfalls.</p>
<p>There are pleasant walks to these falls from Natural Resources Wales car parks at Upper Blaen-y-Glyn (grid referenceÂ SO056176) and Lower Blaen-y-Glyn (SO064169).Â </p>
<h2>3. Henrhyd Falls: the highest waterfall in the Brecon Beacons National Park</h2>
<p>With a drop of 27m, Sgwd Henrhyd, on the River Nant Llech north-west of Glyn-Neath, is the highest waterfall in the National Park.</p>
<p>A walking trail leads to the waterfall from the National Trust car park (grid reference SN853121) near Coelbren, off the A4221 a mile south-east of Abercrave. You follow a steep path down into the mystical wooded valley, with occasional glimpses of the falls through the trees. A wooden bridge takes you across the stream which you then follow up to the pool at the base of Henrhyd Falls. You can then walk down the Nant Llech valley, whose steep sides are lined with sessile oak, ash, small-leafed lime, alder and wych elm trees. This takes you to Henrhyd Small Falls.</p>
