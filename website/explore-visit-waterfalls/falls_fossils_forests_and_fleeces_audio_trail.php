<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Tawe Uchaf Community Council and Brecon Beacons National Park have produced an audio trail oto help visitors enjoy the Nant Llech Waterfall Trail.</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Henrhyd falls crown the head of this facinating valley which is owned and managed by the National Trust. Explore the Waterfalls Trail from where the Llech meets the River Tawe at Abercraf. Walking the trail to Abercraf takes about an hour each way. The path can be uneven, wet and slippery, with some steep climbs. Seats along the trail are good places to rest and enjoy the valley. TAKE CARE and keep to the managed paths at all times. This site has been deignated as a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) so take care not to damage or disturb any wildlife in this beautiful valley.
<br/>
<br/>Along the waterfalls trail there are four audio listening points. You can download these tracks below either to take with you along the route or enjoy a virtual visit along the Nant Llech Waterfaill Trail.
