<h1>Staying safe</h1>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">We want you to have a safe and enjoyable time here in the Brecon Beacons National Park, whether youâ€™re walking alone, in a group or with a four-legged friend.Â </span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<h4>
<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Walking safely</span></span></h4>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re embarking on a low-level stroll or a high-altitude hike. Follow the simple instructions below for a walk youâ€™ll remember for all the right reasons.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Plan ahead</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Know where you are going to walk. Take a map and compass (as well as any leaflets/downloads), and know how to use them. Donâ€™t rely on technology alone the National Park area has some of the poorest mobile signal in Wales.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Take the right equipment</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Make sure youâ€™re wearing suitable clothes and footwear for the type of walk youâ€™re tackling. Take some supplies of water and food with you.</span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Do take a mobile phone with you, but be aware that there are areas without any signal and if you need assistance you may have to change your location by going up a hill, over a hill or down a valley.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Watch and plan for the weatherÂ </strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Consult the weather, mountain and severe weather forecasts before you go, but remember that conditions can change quickly. Itâ€™s recommended always to have extra warm clothes, waterproofs and a hat with you.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Tell someone where you're going</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Make sure that somebody knows your route and what time you expect to be back. Tell them when you get back safely, or if you are delayed or change your plans. Make sure they know what to do if you donâ€™t get back on time.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>If you're in a group, look out for each other</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Be sure that the activity is suitable for all members of the group before you set out. Professional leaders should have first-aid and navigation skills, but if you are a social/family group make sure everyone knows where you are heading and the basic route. Keep together and proceed at the pace of the slowest person. Never abandon anyone because they can't keep up or let members race ahead out of site. Finally, take a group shelter just in case of sudden changes in the weather.</span></div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>If you need help</strong></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">If it is an emergency call 999 and ask for the Mountain Rescue, only the police can alert Mountain Rescue. If it is not an emergency, perhaps ask a a friend to pick up tired walkers or change your route and head to one of the local villages to seek transport back to your start point/vehicle.</span></div>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Follow the Countryside Code at all timesÂ </strong></span></div>
