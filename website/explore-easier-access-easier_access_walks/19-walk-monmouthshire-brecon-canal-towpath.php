<h1>19. A stroll along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is one of the most scenic and spectacular canals in the UK. The towpath winds its way for over 50km between Brecon and Cwmbran and has good views over farmland, woodland and mountains. The canal is also home to a wide range of flora and fauna.</span></span><br/></p><h3>

<br/>
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Access onto the canal bank changes from place to place, as does the path surface. Headroom and the path width are often restricted at bridges. A number of well described, accessible canal-side walks are listed at the www.waterscape.com website. A fantastic short route (500metres) starts at Theatr Brycheiniog and passes interpretation boards, community art projects and a picnic area with a reconstruction of a horse-drawn Hay Railway tram on a short length track.Â  Fishing is allowed along stretches of the canal. For details of fishing permits please contact British Waterways.
