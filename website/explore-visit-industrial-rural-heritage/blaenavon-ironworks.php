It operated from 1789 to 1902. It was steam powered, with three blast furnaces.</p>
<p>The ironworks were at the heart of the industrial landscape of South Wales â€“ without them, none of the quarries, mines, spoilheaps, tramroads, railways, canals, workers houses or civic buildings would have come to exist. The works developed and grew over time and a visitor to the site today can see the remains of six blast furnaces, the casting house and the water balance tower, a hydraulic lift.</p>
<p>The refurbished workersâ€™ cottages and the reconstructed company shop also provide a vivid window onto what conditions were like for the people who worked here. The site is brought to life through careful interpretation, audio posts and exhibitions.Â </p>
