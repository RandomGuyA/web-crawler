<p>The mine operated until 1980 and the mine buildings at Big Pit, including engine houses, stable blocks, workshops and the pithead baths, are a time capsule showing the development of the mine from the 1860s to the 1970s. They have been conserved and transformed so that the life of the pit and the stories of the people that worked on the South Wales Coalfield are brought vividly to life for visitors.</p>
<p>The winding engine and cages are still operational. Visitors are taken down the deep mineshaft by a former collier, to learn first-hand what it was like for the men and boys who worked at the coalface.</p>
<p>On the surface you can visit the original colliery buildings including the Fan House, Blacksmithâ€™s Forge, and Stables and winding Engine House. The Pithead Baths have also been restored showing where miners began and ended their shifts. You can visit the traditional mining exhibition in the Baths building and take a virtual tour through a modern mine.</p>
