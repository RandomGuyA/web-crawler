<h1>The Tithe Barn, Abergavenny</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Abergavenny's Tithe Barn dates back to the 12th century. The building has been restored and converted into an attractive Welsh food hall, shop, cafÃ©, local history centre and exhibition space.</span></p>
<p>Originally, the Tithe Barn housed the tithes (taxes) paid by the local community to the monks of St Mary's Priory, nearby. Over the centuries, the building has been reinvented many times, serving as a coach house, theatre, timber warehouse, grain store, Womenâ€™s Institute shop, carpet warehouse and auction house. In the 1960s, it became Abergavenny's first ever disco.</p>
<p>These days it's a beautiful and popular community and visitor centre, cafÃ© and shop. One of its prize exhibits is a tapestry created by local residents to celebrate the history of Abergavenny and mark the year 2000.</p>
