<h1>Brinore Tramroad</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">Follow the route of the early 19th century horse-drawn railway that used to run between Talybont-on-Usk and Trevil.</span></p>
<p>Completed in 1815, the eight mile Brinore Tramroad once linked the limestone quarries near Tredegar to the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal at Talybont-on-Usk.</p>
<p>It's now a very pleasant walking and cycling route which connects with the Henry Vaughan Walk and the Taff Trail.</p>
<p>It runs from behind the White Hart Inn in Talybont-on-Usk (SO 115225) to the Trevil quarries in the heartland of South Wales. You can start at either end. The route is linear (and slightly uphill from Talybont-on-Usk), but you could make your walk circular by returning to Talybont on the minor road on the west side of the Talybont Reservoir. To extend it, you could add some loops via forestry tracks.</p>
