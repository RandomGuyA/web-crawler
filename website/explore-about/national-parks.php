<h1>What is a national park?</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">In the UK, national parks are areas of exceptional natural beauty which benefit from special protection and management, with great opportunities for everyone to enjoy the outdoors.</span></p>
<p>
<img src="/website/var/tmp/thumb_156__auto_edc33ec922feb18f8c2e5ecb6a7e7ef3.jpeg" style="width: 704px; height: 455px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right;"/>There are 14 national parks in the UK, three of which are in Wales: the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and the Pembrokeshire Coast.</p>
<p>The national park authorities are here to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conserve and enhance the natural beauty, willdife and cultural heritage of the parks</li>
<li>Promote understanding and enjoyment of their special qualities</li>
<li>Foster the social and economic wellbeing of the communities within their boundaries</li></ul>
<p>Dedicated teams look after the countryside and built environment in partnership with many others. But we all have a part to play in shaping the landscape by getting actively involved in protecting its special qualities and planning its future.</p>
<h2>About the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority</h2>
<p>The Brecon Beacons National Park Authority is a special purpose local authority operating within local government. With support from expert staff, its members are responsible for making decisions, setting policies and priorities and ensuring best use of resources.</p>
<p>Two thirds of members are appointed by unitary authorities within the boundary of our Park and one third are appointed by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
<p>Much of the Authority's work is carried out in partnership with other public bodies which also have a duty to take account of National Park purposes in their decisions.</p>
