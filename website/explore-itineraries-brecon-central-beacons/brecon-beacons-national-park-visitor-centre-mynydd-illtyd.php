<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>The National Park Visitor Centre or â€˜Mountain Centreâ€™ is located
<br/>7km south west of Brecon and is one of the most popular visitor
<br/>attractions in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The Centre
<br/>stands 1100ft (330m) above sea level and offers stunning views</strong></span><a href="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/visiting_centre_1.png"><img alt="people sittingoutside building" src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/visit_centre.png" style="width: 172px; margin: 12px; float: right; height: 254px;"/></a><br/>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>of the highest mountains (Pen y Fan and Corn Du) in South</strong></span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Wales.</strong></span><br/>
<br/>In the Centre there are interpretation boards, maps and shortÂ films which explain the history of the National Park and the BreconÂ Beacons. The three dimensional relief map of the entire NationalÂ Park is an extremely popular exhibit and staff are on hand toÂ assist with any enquiries you may have about the National Park.
<br/>
<br/>Throughout the year there are events available such as guidedÂ walks and childrenâ€™s activities, copies of which can be found at theÂ Centre and on the Guided Walks, Children's Activities and FamilyÂ Events pages on our website www.visitbreconbeacons.com/events. OtherÂ facilities include the popular tearooms serving local produce andÂ home cooked food, a gift shop and easy access toilet facilities.Â Outside, families and children can enjoy the large grassed area inÂ front of the building for picnics or to play games.
<br/>
<br/>The adjacent common land, Mynydd Illtyd, offers plenty of easy walksÂ with fantastic views. Route maps are available in the shop or go toÂ the Wildlife Walks page on the website and follow the link to MynyddÂ Illtyd for a nature walk. For mountain biking there are two markedÂ routes to choose from; the easy family Visitor Centre Route or theÂ more challenging Mynydd Illtyd route, both of which can be foundÂ on our mountain biking pages at www.mtbbreconbeacons.co.uk.
