<h1>Spend a day at Llangorse Lake and in Brecon</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p><strong>Llangorse Lake is the larg</strong><img src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/the_lake.png" style="width: 228px; float: right; margin: 12px; height: 341px;"/><strong>est natural lake in the southern half of</strong><br/>
<strong>Wales and was created by glaciers during the last Ice Age.</strong><br/>
<br/>The lake is fed by water running off the surrounding hills and isÂ home to a diverse range of plants and animals. The lake is alsoÂ home to a 9th Century artificial island, known as the CrannogÂ which has a small accessible visitor centre in the style of aÂ thatched, round house.
<br/>
<br/>The grassy common alongside Llangorse Lake is a popular picnicÂ site and often grazed by horses, sheep and sometimes cattle. It isÂ the ideal place to mess about in boats, take a gentle stroll orÂ watch the bird life. Enjoy the Lake Trail which runs from theÂ western end of the lake to Llangasty Church. The route is mostlyÂ flat and is stile-free with way marks and information boards atÂ various points. For those wishing to have a go on the water thereÂ are permits for water sports including sailing, rowing and canoeingÂ available at the Lakeside Shop.
