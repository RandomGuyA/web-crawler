<p><strong>For a great day out why not take a trip on a vintage steam</strong><img src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/railway_1.png" style="width: 195px; margin: 12px; float: right; height: 152px;"/><strong>Â locomotive across this narrow gauge heritage railway that runsÂ beside Pontsticill and Pentwyn Reservoirs.</strong><br/>
<br/>The former Brecon &amp; Merthyr junction railway takes you throughÂ beautiful scenery into the Brecon Beacons National Park alongÂ the full length of the Taf Fechan Reservoir to Dol-y-Gaer. AtÂ Pontsticill you can visit the cafe, admire the view across the waterÂ to the peaks of the Brecon Beacons and go for a ramble alongsideÂ the reservoir. There is also a play area here for children.
<br/>
<br/>On your return to Pant, visit the workshop where old steamÂ locomotives are repaired or follow the new footpath to a picnicÂ site which has an amazing panoramic view of the valley.
