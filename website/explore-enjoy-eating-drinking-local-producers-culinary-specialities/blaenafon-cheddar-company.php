<h1>The Blaenafon Cheddar Company</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">This specialist cheddar cheese company is based in the World Heritage Site of Blaenavon. They make good use of their surroundings - one of their cheeses is matured right at the bottom of a mine shaft.</span></p>
<p>The shop on Broad Street is full of rich, tasty aromas, as cheeses are handmade on the premises.</p>
<p>Blaenafon is best known for its 11 very distinctive cheddars, flavoured with Penderyn Welsh whisky, Welsh white wine, Reverend James ale, Taffy Apple cider and other local ingredients. The four heritage cheddars are coated in different coloured waxes with scenes of Blaenavon's industrial heritage on the labels.</p>
<p>Top points for originality go to Pwll Mawr Cheddar, which is matured at the bottom of the Big Pit mine shaft. This continues a long tradition of maturing cheese underground, where the temperature and atmospheric pressure are perfect.</p>
<p>Among Blaenafonâ€™s other inventions are four scrummy goat's cheeses including one called OMG (Oak-Smoked Mountain Goat).</p>
<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>The Blaenafon Cheddar Company has won many awards and medals for its cheese, including gold at the 2013 International Cheese Awards for its goats cheese, Caws Angel, and several British Cheese Awards for its cheddar.Â </p>
