<h1>Talgarth Mill</h1>

<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">In the small market town of Talgarth, good, locally produced food is a top priority. The town's latest attraction is a community-run, water-powered flour mill and traditional bakery.</span></p>
<p>
<img src="/website/var/tmp/thumb_4974__auto_042e5def3e7a862811cb1326e9a41414.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right; height: 383px;"/>Talgarth Mill is an inspiring example of an eco-friendly food enterprise which really keeps things local. Wheat grown at Lowes Court Farm travels less than five miles to be ground into flour at the newly restored 18th century mill on the River Ellywe in the heart of the town.</p>
<p>The flour is combined with fresh, fragrant organic herbs from the award-winning Primrose Organic Centre in Felindre, or beer from Rotters Brewery, Talgarth's craft microbrewery. These are just some of the ingredients which flavour the speciality loaves that are baked in the wood-fired oven and sold in the mill's own Baker's Table CafÃ© and Bakery.</p>
<h2>Time to get floury</h2>
<p>Drop into the mill and you can take a tour, then sample these luscious loaves, perhaps with some local cheese. If you like the idea of getting a bit floury, you can even book a Miller's Experience Day, grinding your own flour, learning some expert bread-making techniques and lunching at the Baker's Table. There's also ready-ground flour and useful kitchen items for sale in the gift shop, Talgarth Mill Crafts.</p>
<p>Talgarth Mill is part of Taste Talgarth, a community initiative to develop links between local food producers, shops, restaurants and hotels, in order to present delicious food that has travelled the fewest possible miles.</p>
<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>Talgarth Mill has been shortlisted for the 2013 National Tourism Award for Wales.</p>
<h2>Opening hours</h2>
<p>Summer Tueâ€“Sun 10amâ€“4pm, winter Tueâ€“Sun 10amâ€“4pm. Closed Mon.</p>
