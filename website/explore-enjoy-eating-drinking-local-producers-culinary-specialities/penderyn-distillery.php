<span style="font-size:18px;">Before 2004, there hadnâ€™t been an established whisky producer in Wales for a century. Penderyn changed all that. Whisky from the Brecon Beacons is now sold throughout the UK and in more than 20 countries worldwide.</span></p>

<p>In 2004, a group of whisky enthusiasts commissioned a team of scientists to design a new still. Next, all they needed was a site with access to plenty of water.</p>
<p>Situated on moorland with a natural spring (the water adds subtle minerals and a distinctive flavour notes to the whisky), Penderyn near Hirwaun in the western Brecon Beacons proved the perfect spot.</p>
<p>Penderyn has been making liquor aged in wooden barrels including Madeira wine casks, sherry barrels and port barrels, and a smoky peated version, ever since. As well as single malt whiskies, Penderyn makes Brecon Gin and other spirits.Â </p>
<p>Under managing director Stephen Davies â€“ a former steel industry man who appreciates the contrast in his working environment â€“ there are plans to buy two new stills which will triple production.</p>
<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>The Penderyn Distillery has won a long list of impressive awards including an International Wines and Spirits Competition 2012 silver award for its Brecon Special Reserve Gin. In a blind tasting at the same internationally-recognised competition, Penderyn Single Malt Welsh Whisky won a silver medal in the best world whisky class. Not bad for a newcomer to the whisky scene dominated for so long by the Scots and Irish. In 2013, Penderyn was cited in top critic Jim Murrayâ€™s Whisky Bible 2013 as the top European single malt of the year.</p>
<h2>Opening hours</h2>
<p>The distillery visitor centre and shop is open daily, 9amâ€“5pm. Whisky tour and tasting sessions cost Â£6 per person and run hourly (call to book ahead). Whisky Tasting Masterclasses are available on request.</p>
