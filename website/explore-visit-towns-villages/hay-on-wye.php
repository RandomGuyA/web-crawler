<span style="color:#696969;">Hay-on-Wye is a pretty little town swept by the river Wye on the north, with the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons to the south and west, and the lush agricultural land of Herefordshire to the east. It is famous as the town of books, and for the annual Hay Festival. But it is also an excellent base for serious walking with two national trails, the Offaâ€™s Dyke path and the Wye Valley trail passing through the town, and the protected countryside of the Brecon Beacons National Park on it's doorstep.
<br/>
<br/>Once it was a sleepy market town famous only because Francis Kilvert, the diarist lived nearby for nearly two decades in the mid nineteenth century. There was also a local solicitor who got rid of his wife in the early twentieth century by putting weedkiller in her breakfast.
<br/>
<br/>In the 1960s, a young man, Richard Booth, bought Hay castle and declared the town an independent state with him as king. With his cardboard crown, and a sceptre made from a ballcock, he set out to put the town on the map. Improbably, he succeeded. He made it world famous as â€˜the town of booksâ€™.
<br/>
<br/>Today Hay-on-Wye â€“ or Y Gelli Gandryll as it is known in the Welsh language â€“ is friendly, lively and vibrant and, unsurprisingly for a town with such individuality and literary associations, is twinned with Timbuktu, which itself has the oldest Islamic library in the world.
<br/>
<br/>Hay is used to welcoming visitors drawn by the books and by its annual literary festival. President Clinton, speaking there in 2001, called Hay â€˜the Woodstock of the Mindâ€™. There are dozens of second-hand bookshops. There is also a good range of practical shops as well as antique and high-quality art and craft shops, plus high fashion boutiques and practical country wear shops. On Thursdays the market stalls scattered about the town do a roaring trade and the streets are full of groups of people exchanging news.
<br/>
<br/>Tourist gift emporiums full of trinkets are mercifully absent as are one-way-through-traffic systems and multiples. Any number of pubs, cafes, restaurants and take-aways can be found and there is a wide choice of accommodation in the town and surrounding countryside.
<br/>
<br/>Hay-on-Wye has more energetic attractions. Itâ€™s a good base for serious walking in the protected countryside of the Brecon Beacons National Park â€“ Pen-y-fan at 886 metres is the highest point in southern Britain. Offaâ€™s Dyke Path, which extends 173 miles along the England-Wales border between Prestatyn and Sedbury Cliffs near Chepstow, runs through Hay. Then thereâ€™s canoeing on the Wye, sailing on nearby Llangorse Lake, off-road mountain biking, rock climbing, caving, fishing and gliding.
<br/>
<br/>Transport facilities are limited but with the regular bus services you can plan one-way walks. In summer there are special Sunday and Bank Holiday Beacons buses for walkers and the whole area is electric car and bicycle friendly.
<br/>
<br/>And when the sun goes down the sky is dark, the stars come out and you can actually see them. That doesnâ€™t happen in many places nowadays.</span><br/>

A heap of magazines to flick through. A cup of tea to soothe and a wedge of home made cake to accompany. A red kite lazily drifts on the thermals, a tractor rumbles past and times drifts by. Your bedroom with a shower that produces bountiful hot water, a floor that toasts your toes in winter and windows with views over hills and woods. A sumptious mattress to ease your bones, home made biscuits to dunk in your tea. Filtered fresh air without opening a window and wi-fi connections to keep up with your other life.\r\nOur food is our passion - breakfast is home made bread smothered in lemon curd made from Malcolm's eggs. More eggs, but scrambled and topped with smoked salmon from Black Mountain Smokery. Sausages hand made by Sue on her farm down the road, from rare breed organic pork with thick bacon slices from Martin and Kate at Glaiser Farm. Try the special of the day - maybe parmesan and sundried tomato Welsh cakes or potato blinis. Vegetarians have their own menu including spicy lentil burgers and laver bread patties. An option for dinner is the River Cafe at Glasbury for a friendly welcome and a menu to delight. On a summer evening sit on the deck, watch the river drift by and wait for the spectacular dark skies of the Brecon Beacons to enchant.\r\nWhilst you're here - amble into Hay-on-Wye to explore the town of books, Booths a particular joy with a cafe to linger in for coffee and buns. Not books alone, delectable clothes shops and curious antiques to distract and delight. More demanding hiking will reveal miles of peaks and ridges, plunging scarps and views to remember forever or just savour a gentle walk around&nbsp;the local woods teeming with wildlife. Borrow our electric Twizy to challenge your senses with the wind in your hair and the lambs to spy and a tick for your eco credentials.To book online please click through to our website.","url":"\/businesses\/2863"}},{"id":"will_lewis_photography","lat":52.043505,"lon":-3.1944463,"enhanced":null,"popup":{"title":"Will Lewis Photography","image":"","text":"","url":"\/businesses\/2865"}},{"id":"wye_valley_canoes__river_caf","lat":52.0459686,"lon":-3.1962181,"enhanced":true,"type":"activity","popup":{"title":"Wye Valley Canoes","image":"","text":"Wye Valley Canoes, Bikes and Beds sits on the banks of the River Wye four miles west of Hay-on-Wye.
