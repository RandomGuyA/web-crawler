<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span id="parent-fieldname-title">Llangadog, Capel Gwynfe, Bethlehem, Trap, Myddfai and Llanddeusant are the</span>Â villages that make up part of the west of the Brecon Beacons National Park,Â </span></span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">set in the beautiful Carmarthenshire countryside.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><a href="http://www.llangadog.com/">Llangadog</a></strong>Â is situated in the heart of the Towy Valley half way between Llandeilo and Llandovery, and is a focus for all the neighbouring villages - with an excellent village shop, post office, school and family butchers.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Lying on the Heart of Wales Railway, Llangadog is a perfect place to stop off and enjoy the beautiful Towy River and views towards the Black Mountain. The village is well served by good places to stay, eat and drink. There are wonderful opportunities for anglers, and visitors can buy day or weekly permits.
<br/>Â 
<br/>Llangadog Common has been unenclosed grazing since the 13th century and it was a regular stopping place for gypsies in more recent years. At the edge of the common is an old toll house which ran a brisk trade in the 19th century when it charged farmers for collecting lime from the old quarries of the Black Mountain.
<br/>Â 
<br/>Until the 1990s, the fertile Towy valley was the centre of dairying in West Wales, and you can still see the original Llangadog creamery. Llangadog Show is the highlight of the farming year, held on the first Saturday in August and is well worth a visit.Â </span></span><br/>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><a href="http://www.llangadog.com/">Capel Gwynfe</a></strong>Â Capel Gwynfe is a small village about 3 miles to the south of Llangadog, with spectacular views of the Black Mountain. The village has a picturesque church dating from 1898 and a chapel. Look out for 2 large woodcarvings of red kites in the village. In years gone by, the village had 2 pubs, a school, 2 smithies, a corn mill and a woollen factory.Â </span></span><br/>Â </p>

<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><u><strong>The tiny village of
<a href="http://www.llangadog.com/">Bethlehem</a>,</strong></u>named after its chapel, is located between Llandeilo and Llangadog. Perched on the hillside above the Towy flood plain, the road through the village is a popular route for cyclists.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Bethlehem is overlooked by
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/garn-goch">Garn Goch</a>, an impressive Iron Age hill fort which commands fantastic views of the River Towy and across Carmarthenshire. A walk to the top reveals impressive stone walls and banks where you can see mountain ponies roaming freely. Spot a memorial stone on the approach to the hill fort - this was a favourite of Gwynfor Evans, who lived in neighbouring Llangadog and was the first Member of Parliament for the Welsh National Party, Plaid Cymru (1966).
<br/>
<br/>The Post Office is renowned for franking cards at Christmas time and thousands of people each year send their cards to be stamped with the Bethlehem postmark.

<strong><u>Myddfai</u>-Â </strong>The Parish of Myddfai is situated 3 miles south of Llandovery. The scenery is striking, with lanes running through steep wooded valleys giving glimpses of the grandeur of Mynydd Myddfai and the Black Mountain.
<br/>Â 
<br/>At the centre of the parish lies the pretty village of Myddfai with six roads radiating from it providing access to all parts of the community. Most notably, this pretty village was the home of the Physicians of Myddfai, two of whom are commemorated outside the church door.
