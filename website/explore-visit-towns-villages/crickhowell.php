<h4>A small and well-preserved Georgian town on the A40 in the Usk Valley</h4></div>The remains of a 13th century castle still stand in the town whilst the Iron Age hillfort of Crug Hywel, better known as Table Mountain, looks down upon the town from the flanks of Pen Cerrig-calch to the north.</div>
<br/>The Beacons Way which passes through the town will take you steeply up there though more leisurely walks are available beside the River Usk or along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal in nearby Llangattock. You will find that Crickhowell Walking Festival has become very well-established in recent years. You might also want to catch the townâ€™s Dragon Festival.
