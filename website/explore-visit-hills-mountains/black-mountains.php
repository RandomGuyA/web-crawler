<h1>The Black Mountains</h1>
<div class="article-video right clearfix"/>
<p/><p>
<span style="font-size:18px;">The northeast part of the Brecon Beacons National Park is dominated by the Black Mountains, a group of old red sandstone hills, the highestÂ </span><span style="font-size: 18px;">of whichÂ </span><span style="font-size: 18px;">is Waun Fach. They're cloaked in grass and heather and laced with rivers.</span></p>

<p>Apart from Waun Fach (811m), the range has many peaks that are well known to walkers, including Black Mountain (703m), Hay Bluff (677m), the Sugar Loaf (596m) and Ysgyryd Fawr (486m), also known as The Skirrid.</p>
<p>In the past, the area was quarried for sandstone which was used as a building material in the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Culturally, this is a lively area, known for its busy market towns, galleries, food scene and festivals.</p>
