<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span class="s1">Fforest Fawr is a</span><span class="s2">series of isolated hills known as â€˜Fansâ€™ whose grass and heather-clad slopes are broken by occasional crags of Old Red Sandstone.</span><span class="s1"/><span class="s2">It lies between the Black Mountain in the west and the A470 Brecon to Merthyr Tydfil road in the east. The hills drop away into Waterfall Country to the south.</span></span></h3>

It is now used primarily for sheep grazing, conifer plantations, reservoirs and recreation.</p>
<p>This swathe of upland country includes the peaks of Fan Fawr (734m), Fan Frynych (629m), Craig Cerrig-Gleisiad (629m), Fan Llia (632m), Fan Nedd (663m), Fan Gyhirych (725m), Fan Bwlch Chwyth (603m) and Cefn Cul (562m).

<span class="s1">Fforest Fawr Geopark derives its name from the Fforest Fawr massif but covers a much wider area of the national park.</span><br/>Â </p>

<span class="s1"><span class="s1">While</span><span class="s2">it is the sandstone which</span><span class="s1">dominates the geology of</span><span class="s3">Â Â </span>Fforest Fawr,Â </span><span class="s1">Â to the south of the peaks are two north-facing scarps, one of</span><span class="s2">C</span><span class="s1">arboniferous</span><span class="s2">L</span><span class="s1">imestone and the other of</span><span class="s2">Twrch Sandstone, traditionally known as the</span><span class="s1">millstone grit. Further south</span><span class="s2">each of these layers of rock dips</span><span class="s1"/><span class="s2">beneath</span><span class="s1">the South Wales Coalfield. Water rushing southwards from this area has formed steep river valleys with spectacular waterfalls.</span></p>
<p>The area was glaciated during the ice ages. The most dramatic of the remaining glacial cirques, Craig Cerrig-Gleisiad, forms part of a National Nature Reserve, notable for its rare arctic-alpine flora.</p>
